# General syntax for using assign() to create multiple objects using a for loop

for (thing in some_list) { 
  assign(name_of_object, value_you_want_to_assign_to_object)
}

some_list = an iterable object that you want to iterate over
thing = an iteration
assign() is the function that assigns values to objects
name_of_object = the name of the object (you can use paste0() to create a name that relates to each iteration of the iterable object)
value_you_want_to_assign_to_object = the value you will assign to the object at each iteration


# Example
# download the past 15 years of monthly dividend adjusted prices

# import dependencies
library(tseries)                                                        # this library has a function to download stock prices

# information we want to download
stocks = c('MMM', 'AES', 'AAPL', 'BA', 'KO', 'GS', 'JNJ', 'MCD')        # create iterable object to iterate over
start="2003-10-01"; freq = 'm'; quote = 'Adjusted'                      # parameter values


# download data for all the stocks
for (stock in stocks) { 
  assign(stock, get.hist.quote(stock, start=start, quote = quote,retclass="zoo",compression=freq))
}
